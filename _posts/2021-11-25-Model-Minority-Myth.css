Asian Americans grow up with a heavy weight on their chests. Familial pressure, the strain of perfection in school, and general societal expectations force them into the rigid mold of being a ‘Model Minority.’ This creates unreasonably high expectations on Asian Americans, where their accomplishments are downplayed and their struggles are ignored.
The Model Minority Myth stems from the illusion that America is a meritocracy that rewards hard work and bootstrap pulling. Anyone can be in an economically advantageous situation, the people who aren’t just didn’t work hard enough. The differences between minority achievement are down to hard work, family values, and cultural upbringing.
In order to understand how Asians came to be the ‘Model Minority’, there is some important historical context to understand. It begins with the Chinese Exclusion Act, which made Asian American immigration borderline impossible. Other restrictive policies followed such as the Geary Act, and Executive Order 9066, which only further cemented anti-Asian sentiments into the general American consciousness.
After these policies were abolished a large swath of Asian Americans began to immigrate to the United States on work visas. This allowed Asian Americans who were scientists, engineers, and other highly educated professionals to immigrate and bring their families with them thanks to the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. You can see this trend happening when looking at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration Statistics. The Immigration Act of 1990 also increased the number of skilled workers immigrating from India.
What this then creates is a selection effect; only the top percentage of Asian Americans and their families were allowed to immigrate to the United States and people who couldn’t immigrate due to a lack of resources or education were excluded.
Asian Americans aren’t inherently more intelligent nor is their culture the defining factor of their success. The higher SAT scores and educational attainment are because the high-income and educated families — as a result of these restrictive immigration policies — set the precedent of success already. Looking at race-based statistics coupled with a lack of historical knowledge obscures this fact and leads people to make stereotypical assumptions about Asian American intelligence.
Presently, Asian Americans who came through alternative routes, such as being refugees, are very low income and don’t have nearly as much educational attainment.
The label of Asian American includes an extremely diverse set of ethnicities and circumstances, looking at statistics from a birds-eye view obscures a lot of nuances. There is no inherent difference between any minority or ethnic group. Circumstances, education, income level — among other things — are what sets people apart.
When Asian Americans reach the upper echelons of white spaces they frequently find themselves ‘othered’ and used as ammunition against other minorities. Asian Americans may gain high-paying respectable jobs, but they are underrepresented in leadership positions.
Being a ‘Model Minority’ is nothing to strive for, and it doesn’t allot privilege nor the proximity to whiteness that it promises. This article shows how fickle the American consciousness is, how easily public opinion towards minorities can change. Specifically, it shows how 9/11 changed America’s social perception of Muslim Americans. We saw a little of this happen during the emergence of Covid-19 and suddenly the respect that Asian Americans had garnered from the white majority was broken and they were ‘othered’ again.
Hopefully, through this compilation of resources and information, a larger picture is painted and this myth can be put to bed.
